# DarkPulse.py  
_A silent RF disruption tool._  

### What It Does:  
- **Generates undetectable RF pulses to disrupt communication systems**  
- **Forces IoT devices, drones, and security sensors into failure states**  
- **Avoids detection by embedding pulses within background noise**  
- **Overloads signal receivers without appearing on spectrum scans**  

### Who Is It For?  
_"A pulse that is silent is a pulse that is ignored—until it’s too late."_  

### How to Use:  
1. Deploy **DarkPulse** on a T-Embed CC1101 module  
2. Activate the silent disruption pulse:  
   ```bash
   python3 DarkPulse.py --start
